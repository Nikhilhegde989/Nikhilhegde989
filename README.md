# Hey, I’m Nikhil 👋

I build GenAI systems and high-performance backend services.

Currently working on:
- 🧠 RAG pipelines & agent-based AI workflows  
- ⚡ Designing high-concurrency APIs  
- 🗄️ Optimizing PostgreSQL queries & reducing latency  
- 🔄 Async-first backend architectures  
- 🚀 Productionizing AI systems (not just demos)

I care about performance, clean service boundaries, and systems that survive real-world load.
