# Hey, I'm Nikhil 👋

I build GenAI systems and high-performance backend services.

Right now I'm focused on:
- 🧠 Building RAG pipelines and agent-based AI workflows
- ⚡ Designing high-concurrency APIs
- 🗄️ Optimizing PostgreSQL queries and reducing latency
- 🔄 Writing async-first backend systems
- 🚀 Turning LLM prototypes into production-ready systems

I enjoy working at the intersection of AI systems and backend engineering — where performance, reliability, and clean architecture actually matter.
